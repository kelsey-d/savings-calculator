# Savings Calculator

I have a savings account with Wealthfront that I love but I found myself hand calculating my projected savings when home hunting. For any purchase goal, this calculator can help determine what you can afford and set realistic goals. 

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Form Validation**: Cuts down on errors caused by incorrect inputs.
- **Responsive UI**: Clean accessible user interface.
- **Minimal Libraries**: Challenges me to write fucntions and to discover out of the box solutions
  

## ðŸ“¦ Installation  
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Improvements
- More precise calculations given transaction data
- More precise validation with TypeScript
- Engaging visual for results view
